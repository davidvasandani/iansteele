  <h3>The Challenge</h3>
  <p> SALUTE helps deliver short term financial assistance to bridge the temporary income gaps and meet the basic needs of post 9/11 veterans. They came to us for a redesign of their outdated existing website. With non-tech savvy users maintaining their website, they needed a wordpress site that made it easy to share stories and upcoming events.</p>

  <h3>The Outcome</h3>
  <p>These veterans are dads, moms, brothers, sisters,  and children. Normal people who have gone above and beyond to serve the USA, and theyâ€™ve fallen on hard times. My goal was to help tell their stories, and how the folks at SALUTE help these veterans get back on their feet when they needed it most.</p>
