<!-- Well, day 1 of the festival has completed!!!  I'll save the individual
call outs for tomorrow when it's all a wrap, but I can't tell you how proud I am
of everyone who has touched this project. We had over 1,000 viewers with an
average watch time of 1 hour and 18 minutes and over 8,000 chat messages.
Engagement was high and reviews in the chat and on social media were even higher.
Can't wait for Day 2, but for those that couldn't join here was the festival
in a nutshell: (edited)

I did not think it was possible, but Day 2 of the festival went just as good, if
not better, than Day 1! Today we had over 830 viewers and held strong through
another impromptu after-party with 600 or so viewers. The chat saw 829 unique
users, 505 of which engaged in messaging and a total of over 7,300 individual
messages. Throughout the weekend we had a “drop” rate as we like to refer to in
the live event world of 89% (1,830 viewers out of 2,050 ticket holders) and over
15,000 chat messages! Anddd the best part is we raised about $7,500 and counting
for Restaurant Strong Fund so far.

The Virtual Festival was conceptualized, negotiated, put on sale, technology
built, beer curated, programming/content developed, rehearsed, and executed in a
matter of 50 days. A ton of hard work went into this and it paid off. I can
confidently say Untappd will be positioned as the leader in the Virtual Festival
world which will only help to bring positive brand awareness to our live events
happening in the near future! Individuals from almost every department in Untappd
came together in a true collaborative effort to make this happen and it made me
so proud and excited to work for a company that can so graciously do that. -->

  <h3>The Challenge</h3>
  <p> During the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, Untappd cancelled the 2nd Annual
    Beer Festival. Given that the service industry had been hit so hard, Untappd
    pivoted to host our first Virtual Beer Festival in order to raise money for
    the
    <a class="button--text" href="https://www.restaurantstrong.org/index.html">Restaurant Strong Fund</a>
    .

  <p>
    After integrating a feature-rich assessment authoring platform, LearnZillion assessments allowed for much more functionality. Now, a single question could now have multiple parts which could be any combination of auto-graded and/or manually graded components.</p>
  <p>We needed a way to quickly let see teachers how their classes are doing, while allowing them to easily see which questions required their attention.</p>
