  <h3>The Challenge</h3>
  <p> During the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, Untappd cancelled the 2nd Annual
    Beer Festival. Given that the service industry had been hit so hard, Untappd
    pivoted to host our first Virtual Beer Festival in order to raise money for
    the
    <a class="button--text" href="https://www.restaurantstrong.org/index.html">Restaurant Strong Fund</a>
    .
  </p>
  <p> Myself and my fellow designer were tasked with creating a marketing site
    for the virtual festival. Due to our tight deadline, I focused on the graphics
    of the page, while Rob tackled the typography and development. Together we
    explored the organization of page content.

  <h3>The Outcome</h3>
  <p>The Untappd Virtual fest was conceptualized, negotiated, put on sale,
    developed, curated, rehearsed, and executed in 50 days. It took a ton of
    effort and communication across teams, but together we were able to accomplish
    the following:
