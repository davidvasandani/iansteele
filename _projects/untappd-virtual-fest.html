  <h3>The Challenge</h3>
  <p> During the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, Untappd cancelled the 2nd Annual
    Beer Festival. Given that the service industry had been hit so hard, Untappd
    pivoted to host our first Virtual Beer Festival in order to raise money for
    the
    <a class="button--text" href="https://www.restaurantstrong.org/index.html">Restaurant Strong Fund</a>
    .
  </p>
  <p> Myself and my fellow designer were tasked with creating a marketing site
    for the virtual festival. Due to our tight deadline, I focused on the graphics
    of the page, while Rob tackled the typography and development. Together we
    explored the organization of page content.

  <h3>The Outcome</h3>
  <p>Untappd sold ~2,050 tickets for the two-day virtual fest. Throughout the
    weekend we had a “drop” rate 89% (1,830 viewers out of 2,050 ticket holders) and over
  15,000 chat messages! Anddd the best part is we raised about $7,500 and counting
  for Restaurant Strong Fund so far.
  </p>

  <p>The Virtual Festival was conceptualized, negotiated, put on sale, technology
  built, beer curated, programming/content developed, rehearsed, and executed in a
  matter of 50 days. A ton of hard work went into this and it paid off.
