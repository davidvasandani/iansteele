    <h3>About MK Films</h3>
    <p> MK Films is a world class tabletop commercial production house providing
       clients with endless opportunities to translate their visions into reality.
       Since 2004, directors Darren Weninger and Mark Klein have produced superior
       work by approaching every storyboard with creative innovation, cutting-edge
       techniques and artful cinematography. The skilled directors and supporting
       production team deliver distinctive advertising content to enhance clients’
       visions and branding.</p>
    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <p>MK Films came to kohactive looking to redesign their web presence. Their
      existing website looked outdated and lacked a focus on their video production
      work.

    <h3>The Outcome</h3>
    <p>These veterans are dads, moms, brothers, sisters,  and children. Normal people who have gone above and beyond to serve the USA, and they’ve fallen on hard times. My goal was to help tell their stories, and how the folks at SALUTE help these veterans get back on their feet when they needed it most.</p>
