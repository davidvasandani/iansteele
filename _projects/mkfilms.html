    <h3>About MK Films</h3>
    <p> MK Films is a world class tabletop commercial production house providing
       clients with endless opportunities to translate their visions into reality.
       Since 2004, directors Darren Weninger and Mark Klein have produced superior
       work by approaching every storyboard with creative innovation, cutting-edge
       techniques and artful cinematography. The skilled directors and supporting
       production team deliver distinctive advertising content to enhance clientsâ€™
       visions and branding.</p>

    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <p>MK Films came to kohactive looking to redesign their web presence. Their
      existing website looked outdated and lacked a focus on their video production
      work.

    <h3>Discovery & Ideation</h3>
    <p>
      I facilitated discussions with MK Films to learn the goals of their business and
      reviewed the shortcomings of their existing website. With a better understanding of
      their focus and audience, I began sketching and wireframing possible directions for
      their new website.

    with a website that put their work in the forefront. </p>
