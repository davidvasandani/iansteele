    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <p> At Untappd for Business, one of our core offerings is the ability to
      display digital menu boards in your business. These menus used Chromebits
      to feature ads, announcements, patron check-ins, customizable templates,
      and the ability to display single pages or rotate through mutiple pages.
      Untappd maintained an inventory of Chromebit devices and logitech keyboards
      that we sold at cost. When Chromebits were discontinued, this left us with
       a stock of soon to be obsolete devices and at risk of losing one of our
       core value adds.

    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><p>- No longer require Untappd to manage inventory.</p></li>
      <li><p>- Decrease barrier to entry for Digital Menus</p></li>
      <li><p>- Limit technical support from our small team</p></li>
      <li><p>- Reduce setup time for customers</p></li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Customer Pain Points</h3>
  <p>Customers were required to purchase our Digital Board Kits at $129/screen
    and follow a complicated setup process. Due to the way chromebits rendered
    on TVs, this setup often had an array of issues such as off-centered images,
    overscan, or pixelated images.

  <h3>The Outcome</h3>
  <p>In addition to no longer maintain inventory, Untappd reduced the amount of
    support required for our digital menus both from both of our engineering and
    customer success teams.
  </p>
  <p>While the benefits for Untappd were exciting to see, our customers received
    the largest gains. In addition to the ability to purchase a FireTV device at
    any big-box store, our customers now have:
