  <h3>The Challenge</h3>
  <p> At Untappd for Business, one of our core offerings is the ability to
    display digital menu boards in your business. These menus feature ads,
    announcements, patron check-ins, customizable templates, and the ability to
    display single pages or rotate through mutiple pages.
  </p>
  <p> Untappd maintained an inventory of Chromebit devices and logitech keyboards
     that we sold at cost. When Chromebits were discontinued,
     this left us with a stock of soon to be obsolete devices..

  <h3>Customer Pain Points</h3>
  <p>Customers were required to purchase our Digital Board Kits at $129/screen
    and follow a complicated setup process. Due to the way chromebits rendered
    on TVs, this setup often had an array of issues such as off-centered images,
    overscan, or pixelated images.
