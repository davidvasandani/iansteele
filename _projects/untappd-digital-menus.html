  <h3>The Challenge</h3>
  <p> At Untappd for Business, one of our core offerings is the ability to
    display digital menu boards in your business. These menus used Chromebits to feature ads, announcements, patron check-ins, customizable templates, and the ability to
    display single pages or rotate through mutiple pages. Untappd maintained an inventory of Chromebit devices and logitech keyboards
     that we sold at cost. When Chromebits were discontinued,
     this left us with a stock of soon to be obsolete devices.

  <h3>Customer Pain Points</h3>
  <p>Customers were required to purchase our Digital Board Kits at $129/screen
    and follow a complicated setup process. Due to the way chromebits rendered
    on TVs, this setup often had an array of issues such as off-centered images,
    overscan, or pixelated images.
